[New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, to answer those questions I have created dashboard to visualize and report on the data collected.

The data used for this project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DLpKL5OK69oRENLCbmr_d_B-h7dn4Ewr?usp=sharing)
## Objectives

**There were two unexpected phenomenas foudn from the data collected**

* The number of members out number the number of guest users on the program, despite NYC being a big tourist city
* The trips taken by members are shorter on average versus the casual user

**I have created a Data Visualization Story/Dashboard to support this finds which can be view [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ramon.faylona/viz/citibike-challenge-tableau/Citibike-SummerinNYC2021?publish=yes)** 

**The Dashboard offers up a few insights on the Program at the time period of Summer in NYC 2021**
